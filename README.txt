Tools to calculate observables like correlation functions and lensing cross-powers in the halo model
As many steps as possible implemented with numpy for speed

1. Make environment (I use anaconda) with numpy, scipy, astropy, pyccl, optionally emcee
2. pip install colossus, mcfit
3. Set params in params.py

See notebooks/showcase.ipynb for usage
